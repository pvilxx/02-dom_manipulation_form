| **HTML: Structure**       | The HTML is poorly structured with non-semantic elements, lacks any a11y considerations, and doesn't resemble the structure. | The HTML structure is largely incorrect or unclear, with major semantic and accessibility issues.                        | The HTML is functional but contains notable issues such as improper use of divs or spans, missing labels, or insufficient a11y practices.                     | The HTML is mostly semantic but may have some minor misuses of elements or lacks minor accessibility considerations.                         | The HTML follows all semantic HTML5 practices, uses appropriate tags, ensures accessibility (a11y), and has a well-structured layout.                 | 25%       |
| **CSS: Layout & Styles**  | The styles are minimal or non-existent, with no consideration for responsiveness, BEM, or theme modes.                       | The styles are mostly missing or poorly implemented, with significant issues in responsiveness, BEM, or light/dark mode. | The styles are somewhat implemented, but BEM notation is inconsistently followed. Issues with responsiveness, light/dark mode are incomplete or inconsistent. | The styles are mostly implemented with minor issues in BEM notation or responsiveness. Light and dark modes are functional but inconsistent. | The styles are fully implemented with correct BEM notation, proper use of CSS variables, and adhere to mobile-first principles. Layout is responsive. | 25%       |
| **JavaScript: Behavior**  | JavaScript is either missing or does not function at all, with no attempt at interactivity.                                  | JavaScript is largely incorrect or missing, with incomplete functionality or broken form submission/DOM manipulation.    | JavaScript works partially but has major issues in form validation, DOM manipulation, or data sanitization. Features may not work as expected.                | JavaScript is mostly functional, with minor bugs in form handling, validation, or DOM manipulation. Code follows good practices.             | JavaScript is fully functional with form submission handling, data validation, sanitization, and DOM manipulation. Code follows best practices.       | 40%       |
| **Git & GitHub Workflow** | Git is not used, or the version control process is severely lacking (e.g., no commits or repository setup).                  | Git usage is minimal, with only a couple of commits and a lack of proper workflow (e.g., no branches or pull requests).  | Git is used inconsistently, with few commits or little adherence to best practices (e.g., improper branching).                                                | Git is used adequately with a reasonable number of commits and proper branching but minor issues in the pull request process or frequency.   | Git is used extensively with frequent, meaningful commits. Workflow follows best practices with branching, pull requests, and documentation.          | 5%        |
| **CI/CD: Deployment**     | The project is not deployed, or Netlify configuration is severely lacking.                                                   | The project is deployed on Netlify, but it is either not accessible, or there is no automatic deployment process (CD).   | The project is deployed on Netlify, but continuous deployment is only partially configured or requires manual steps.                                          | The project is deployed on Netlify and CD is mostly functional but minor issues (e.g., missing custom domain or manual deployment required). | The project is correctly deployed on Netlify, with continuous deployment (CD) fully set up. Auto deployment after pushes to `main`. Custom domain.    | 5%        |
